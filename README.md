# MapPad
# A Notepad for better experience
<p> I hear that you want a notepad which directly opens your code (like html for instance) without needing to do a lot of steps to really open it? If so, let me introduce you to MapPad or MemoPad notepad</p>
<h1> Features </h1>
- Versatile for file functions
- Easy to use
- User Friendly Interface!
- Rate your experience on it
- do a lot with it
- Good for opening code in which html codes are done and executed
- Very less storage space needed


<p> <b> How do you like it? </b>  You may want to use python compiler for the best possible experience with it </p>

# Updates
<p> Version 5 Memopad Released, Check it now! </p>
<p> <b> Note: </b> You may need to modify the code to also adjust with the new icon. This applies to all the versions of Memopad you are using. </p>
<p> Incase you cannot use the icon, you may want to use <b> WITHOUT_ICON_CODE_VERSION </b> so that you dont need to use the default version
<p> I recommend using Version 5 as this is better than the previous version </p>
<p> Version 5 is <b> NOW AVAILABLE </b> in <b> GITHUB </b> Here there is an error log where it describes the errors a user faces while the user was running the program. </p>
<p> I now opened the discussions in github. Now you can tell your experince with it there. You can also tell all the bugs you faced </p>
<p> I also added codeql workflow. </p>
<p> Plus, I added a wiki where I explain my notepad. Just check it. I will be adding a lot of other things.

<p> Oh I just forgot. If you want to rate my pad, just click on the link below. It will take you to a form you can fill about your experience with Memopad </p>
