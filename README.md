<p> <b> How do you like it? </b>  You may want to use python compiler for the best possible experience with it </p>

# Updates
<p> Version 4 Memopad Released, Check it now! </p>
<p> <b> Note: </b> You may need to modify the code to also adjust with the new logo. This applies to all the versions of Memopad you are using. </p>
<p> I recommend using Version 4 as this is better than the previous version </p>
