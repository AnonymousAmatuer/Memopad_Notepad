# MapPad
# A Notepad for better experience
<p> Have you ever wanted a notepad that could open files you normally couldn't open with notepad? Like '.dgs' or '.jfd' or anything like it? If so, Let me introduce you to Mapad</p>
<h1> Features </h1>
- Versatile for file functions
- Easy to use
- User Friendly Interface!
- Rate your experience on it
- do a lot with it
- Good for opening code in which html codes are done and executed


<p> <b> How do you like it? </b>  You may want to use python compiler for the best possible experience with it </p>

# Updates
<p> Version 4 Memopad Released, Check it now! </p>
<p> <b> Note: </b> You may need to modify the code to also adjust with the new icon. This applies to all the versions of Memopad you are using. </p>
<p> I recommend using Version 4 as this is better than the previous version </p>
<p> Version 4 now has clear function that clears anything and also a version tab to identify which version you are using </p>
<p> I now opened the discussions in github. Now you can tell your experince with it there. You can also tell all the bugs you faced </p>
<p> I also added codeql workflow. </p>
<p> Plus, I added a wiki where I explain my notepad. Just check it. I will be adding a lot of other things.

<p> Oh I just forgot. If you want to rate my pad, just click on the link below. It will take you to a form you can fill about your experience with Memopad </p>
